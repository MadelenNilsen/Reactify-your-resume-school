I have built a CV website with React and Redux showcasing my projects, experience and contact details. It includes a dark theme toggle, a contact form, a profile, a CV and a project section fetching data from my GitHub API.

My Design:
My website follows a dark/light theme where in light mode you get pop of colors that makes the website fun to look at, and while in dark mode you get a subdued, easy on the eyes website that doesn't make your head hurt.



Features:
Dark mode toggle using Redux.
Responsive design for all screen sizes.
Navigation using React Router.
Contact form with auto-focus using useRef.
Display of my GitHub projects using an API.

Dependencies:
React.
Redux Toolkit.
React Router.
Vite.
Font Awesome.

useState, useEffect, useRef.
